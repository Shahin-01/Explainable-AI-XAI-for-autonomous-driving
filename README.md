# Explainable-AI-for-autonomous-driving
In this repository, we provide a compendium of state-of-the-art studies focused on explainable AI (XAI) for autonomous driving. These studies are primarily based on developing explainable convolutional neural network (CNN), reinforcement learning (RL), and recurrent neural  networks (RNN)-based AI architectures for autonomous driving.
